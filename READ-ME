To run the javascript for spell check
1) First run the BKTree.java file to create the BK Tree
2) Add the SWT jars provided with the code. They should be automatically added as I have included them in libs folder.
3) In the run configuration window. Add to arguments -d32 if you have a MAC OS with 64 bit system.
4) Add the word to the text field of the window generated and click on the button. Spell check will work! :)
